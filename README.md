# battleSheepBoardGame
It’s you
against the browser: the browser hides ships
and your job is to seek them out and destroy them.
Of course, unlike the real Battleship game, in this
one you don’t place any ships of your own. Instead,
your job is to sink the computer’s ships in the fewest
number of guesses.
Goal:
Sink the browser’s ships in the fewest number
of guesses. You’re given a rating, based on how well
you perform.
Setup
: When the game program is launched, the
computer places ships on a virtual grid. When that’s
done, the game asks for your first guess.
How you play:
The browser will prompt you to
enter a guess and you’ll type in a grid location. In
response to your guess, you’ll see a result of “Hit”,
“Miss”, or “You sank my battleship!” When you sink
all the ships, the game ends by displaying your rating.
